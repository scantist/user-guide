# Overview
The Scantist SCA is source-code analysis tool for C/C++ that identifies vulnerabilities and compliance issues pertaining to the use of open-source components in your projects and applications.
* Vulnerabilities – The tool looks for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and developer-patched security fixes (Security Bugs), as well as partial-matches for the two (Vulnerable Clones). The tools also offers potential code-fixes for the same.
* Licenses – The tool also looks for open-source libraries used in your project, and alerts you if there exist any potential license compliance issues i.e. if any of the open-source components are licensed in a way that disallows your use-case (distribution, liability etc) the tool will notify you of the same.
